  <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
  <p>Our primary goal in collecting personally identifiable information is to provide you with information that you request from
    us via your use of the Site. Personally Identifiable Information. In general, it is not necessary to provide us with your
    personally identifiable information to use the Site. There are certain services we offer, however, which require the submission
    of personally identifiable information, such as your name, physical address, and email address. If you contact us through
    the Site or otherwise, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address,
    and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.</p>
  <p>We may also use your personally identifiable information to send you other publications or information that may be of interest
    to you. In addition, we may send you important administrative information regarding the Site and/or services we offer via
    the Site. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe
    or opt-out instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>
  <h4>Log Data.</h4>
  <p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website
    ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you
    are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider (or "ISP"), the IP address will be
    different every time you log on. We use it to monitor use of the Site and the services we offer via the Site and for the
    Site’s technical administration.</p>
  <h4>Cookies</h4>
  <p>Like many websites, we may also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site
    and the services we offer via the Site. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We
    do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. However, IP addresses are collected by the use of cookies.</p>
  <p>We mainly use "session cookies", which enable certain features of the Site and services we offer via the Site, to better
    understand how you interact with the Site and services we offer via the Site, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and
    web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and services we offer via the Site.</p>
  <p>This session cookie is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. Most Internet browsers automatically
    accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
    accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Information Sharing and Disclosure Service Providers. Entity may employ
    third party companies and individuals to facilitate the provision of services via the Site, or to perform certain Site-related
    services (e.g., hosting and maintenance services, database management and improvement of the Site’s features).</p>
  <p>We may from time to time share your personally identifiable information with such third parties to administer or complete
    these tasks. These third parties only have access to your information as necessary to perform their functions and may not
    use it for any other purpose. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Entity cooperates with government and law enforcement
    officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
  </p>
  <p>We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole
    discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal processes (including subpoenas), to protect the
    property and rights of Entity or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal,
    unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</p>
  <h4>Business Transfers</h4>
  <p>If any or all of the assets of Entity are acquired by, or merged with another entity, we will share some or all of your information
    with this entity. Security Entity is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable
    information. We employ administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized
    access.</p>
  <p>We will disclose any compromise of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored
    "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous
    posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate
    needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable
    integrity of the data system.</p>
  <h4>International Transfer</h4>
  <p>Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or
    other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.</p>
  <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
  <p>Our Site may contain links to other websites, including those of our clients and partners. If you choose to visit an advertiser
    by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact
    that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party.</p>
  <p>We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on
    your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure
    of information that we collect from you through this Site. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure
    of the personal information you submit to them.</p>
  <p>We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. Our Policy Towards Children
    This Site is not directed to children under 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided
    us with personally identifiable information without their consent, they should contact us. If we become aware that a child
